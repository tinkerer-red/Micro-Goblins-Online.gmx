=====Weapon Mods=====


===Toy===
Prop (it's a modifier to allow for prop hunt, basically turns you into a prop object for a while, the higher the mod the longer it lasts, 6 is infinate untill death, mechanically speaking this acts more like invisibility, enemy AI simly wont see you if you arent moving) 
Speed Up (the portal 2's orange gel)
Laser pointer, when an entity is seeking an enemy it has a high chance to follow the laser pointer
Betrail (allows for the collision event to be applied to allies too, useful for healing weapons and heat seeking)
Healing (heals the collided entity)
Overcharge (buffs the collided entity for a short time, mod count = length of time, and buff strength)
Rainbow (the hue of the weapon is continuously changing, mod count = change speed)
Psycho (All mods attempt to do the opposite, so heat seaking would steer away from enemies, guiding would move in the oposite direction of the player's inputs etc)


===Global===
+++Repeater (Full Auto attacks)
Spray (much like repeater although much faster, inacurate, and massive damage decrease)
+++Charge (you must charge up the weapon first, massive damage increase)
Dynamic Charge (much like charge although has a max charge of 5 seconds)
++Dash
++Evade
+++Enlarge (double the size of the weapon and projectiles)
+++shrink (half size)
+++AimBot
Latent (delays the weapon spawn)
Accelerate (Increase attack speed for each consecutive shot. Resets one second after the attack)
Dynamic Charge
AOE (this gives AOE, multiples cause larger AOE size) (radius = 16+(16*modcount))
+continuous (modcount = dmge tick increased, this will make an AOE continuous, or cause tick based damage, mutliples cause longer time for aoe)
+knockback
Exstingish (reduce the size of AOE/continuous attacks by one)
Exploding corpses (Dead enemies will explode when their body disapears, explosion size relative to modcount, with a mod count of 1 you just need to hit the enemy 1 second before death to explode it, otherwise it wont explode, 5 mod count will give you a 5 second timer. enlarged creatures gives a +50% explosion radius per enlarge, calculated after initial radius calculation, each section of the enemy will also explode, so msnake creatures, and decapitated heads will both create their own explosions)
Soul Consumer (Massive damage increase, although it requires souls to make use of)
Soul Extractor (will grant you souls for every kill)
Kinesis (on collision, freeze the player and enemy for a second or so and allow the player to adjust where the knockback will be applied, similar to golf mechanics, or breath of the wilds kinesis effect)
Tractor Beam (make a list of all enemies infront of the weapon, for each enemy allign them slightly closer to the center point of the line, and move them to the player, like the gravity gun)
Consumable (makes the item a one time use, not ever something the player would want, but it would be useful for AI created items)


???  CHANCE BASED MODS  ???
Shockwave (create a wide projectile which deals small damage but adds a slight knockback and pierce, modcount = range and width)
Radience (on collision chance to create a healing ally AOE)
Meteor (on collision chance to spawn a meteor from the sky which lands on an enemy)


vampirism/leech (chance to gain life after a kill)
Force Push (at weapon spawn (just after it spawns) force push shit away)
Force Pull (happens before melee weapon spawns)
grapple (force pull at collision)    /    lode stone (continuous force pull on hit enemy)
knockback (force push at collision)
Soulbound (can't be dropped)

Stasis (esentially freeze / stun effect; mod count = stasis time)

Chain Lightning (hits each enemy in a certain distance, 1*modcount = arcs)
Teleport (teleports the colided to a random open position)
Frost (slows the target)
Blind (when mixed with aoe and continuous, this becomes the fog of war)

==general damage and death effects==
	Keen (general damage increase, and decapitation increased chance {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})
	Gibbing (general damage increase, and greatly increase gibbing chance by removing the chance for decap {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})
	Incinoration (need shader but make a magma texture slowly consume the players model, then replace with ask which drops to a pile, look around for insperations)


===Melee===
+++Swift (swings Faster)
+++Slow (swings slower)
+++Ranged (unlocks ranged mods for the melee weapon, assigns a random projectile sprite perminately)
+++Back Stab (swings behind you; also?)
Cyclone (links charged sword swing, swing the weapon in a circle, just copy the flail code)
Plumble (when collided with an enemy tapping will cause additional damage, enemy players can dash out, and repeater stacks with this mod)
Perry (perry reflects projectiles, while blade turn will reflect melee weapons 90 degrees to the side of the enemy player)
blade turn (if colliding with an enemy's weapon buttom mash to see who deals extra damage, this mod does not proc if the enemy is already in the damage dealt list)

+++moveable (unlocks the ability to move while swinging, although it also allows you to guide which direction you are attacking, the change in direction is effected by mod count)

+++Chained (Similar to yoyo's and Flail maces, good for rope darts and what not)
+++Thrust (Chun Li kick annimation for weapons) (multiple will act as a combo attack from a single button press)
+++slash
+++Flail (changes the attacking method into a flail attack, adds attack range but makes it a bit slower.) (multiples will give it a further reach)
+++Extend (at the end of the attack animation, extend the reach of the weapon infront of the player by 2tiles*mod_count)
Throwable (tapping the attack button will cause for a normal swing although holding it for 0.25 of a second will throw it, holding it for a full second will throw it at max range, and the max range is dictated by weapon range + modcount)
whip (Will need to be able to make use of paths, and stretched sprites to path, will need at least 60 paths for the animation... uhhhg)


"deception"? (damages you when using it although greatly increased damge, slight increase to size, and adds a color effect to the sprite?)
Keen/vorpal (slightly increases damage, greatly inreases decapitation chance)
Jaws (1 modcount = 2 melee weapons lerch out from the side clamping down infront of the player, mod5 = 10)
Reflect (reflects bullets back at their owner)
Aerial Strike (every time you hit it spawn a copies of itself, which slams into the ground)
??AutoSwing (This is NOT rapid fire! As long as it's actively equipped it will automatically swing at enemies, if reflect is also on the weapon it wil swing at projectiles too)
??punching glove (doesnt matter what weapon you're using, it launches a punching glove out aswell)

===Ranged===
Divine Spray "spray and pray" (inaccuracy + similar to rewpeater although used for use with card shuffler, flame thrower, cone of fire)
Ray beam (turns the entire projectile into a ray, not really sure what this intails although the words, freeze ray made me think of this one.)
+++Sticky (projectiles exclusive continuous mod)
Piercing (attacks through multiple enemies)
+++Ricochet (projectiles will bounce 1 time if coliding at a 45 degree angle or less, if piercing is present they will bounce at any angle but only 5 times)
ethernal (attacks through walls)
+++boomerang (returning projectiles, 1 floor collision prevention)
+++nega-rang? (return TO the projectile) //get a better name for this. its a bit like a hook shot, but probably instant? maybe add the vectors?
+++inaccurate (random projectile angles)
Scoped/Snipe (Extra range)
Quick shot (projectiles move at double speed)
Drag (projectiles move at half speed)
+++seeking (heat seeking projectiles)
+++guided
+++Burst (3 shots in a row, with a 2-3 frame delay between them, input direction can be chnged but not movement?)
+++Laser/Beam (10 shots in a row, every frame) Drops the damage and cooldown time by a ton.
+++Cluster (it's like buck shot but happens after the projectile was sent out)
+++Multishot (3 projectile)
+++Bonus Shot (1 projectile in a random angle)
+++Mirror Shot (Shoots a projectile behind you)
+++Targeting
+++Air Strike
Bouncy (when colliding with ground, bounce in a random angle with in a 180 degree cone of where it's headed, number of bounces is relative to mod count, distance gets cut in half each time, and speed drops by 33%)
"Ray Casting", or "ray tracing", or just "tracer" (this has a very very small heat seeking adjustment, although it will skip the step events, and jump dirrectly to collision events, In practice this means that the projectiles will appear to spawn directly on their targets, usefull for a BFG or a cone of electricity type weapon [example: electro gun GTA2])
Welder (similar to repeater although it keeps the weapon spawned, creating new projectiles, although will over heat depending on how many mods it has, although this also means more projectiles come out faster aswell)

Arc Lightning (lightning arcs between your projectiles and your self, similar to laser but more dynamic, 3*modcount lightning arcs)
air born (projectile floats in place for a bit before acvtually launching forward)
scatter shot (similar to multishot although you get 3 times as many, size decrease, with a ton of inaccuracy, and 1/3 the range)









===Summon===
Ranged mod, allows for use of pokeball style summons

-----health styles (default is normal health)
---new---
	Regenerative (when under it's defined max health, heal up, this is passive)
	Regrowth (Max Health is devided into 2 health bars, one of which is 2/3 the health required to knock them to the floor, making them inactive, 1/3 of the health bar is used to dictate how many extra hits required to hit them before they get back up, when they get back up their "to get knocked down" health bar is fully restored, although their "knocked down to kill" health bar will never be reestablished, no matter the synergies) [insert tubthumping joke somewhere "i get knocked down!"]
	+++++Timed (has 9999 health but will die on it's own after a specific amount of time, likely based on health prior to this)
	[NAME THIS] (on player collision, die) [for use with chests]
	Loot (on death drop items, the items dropped will either be random, or based on the name of the etity, unless it's player summoned then only drop common-uncommon items no matter the mod count) [An entity name like "tree" will only drop apples and wood, where an entity name like "crate" will drop items from the dungeon pool, and "chest" will drop usable items only]
	Segmented (basically snake like creatures which have sections, modcount*2+1 = segments; Only the head is effected by knockback?)
	Headless (On death the head gains flying and can not attack anymore, really only usefull if collision damage is still active, otherwise pointless)
	Swarm (makes modcount more of the same spawn with 75% damage, and slight max speed increase) (they should also completely ignore each other's collision, and only the leader dictates which way they move, the rest will cycle through the directional inputs in a counter clockwise direction, and average the direction to the leader, the leaders, inputs*2, and their current spin direction.)
	Hive Mind (This should probably be a passive effect, if there are entities >=4 of the same name and owner_id, Then every other frame they only use the leader's movements, or move towards the leader?)
	
[Health] Multiply (on death split into 1+modcount more of it's self at half the size and health)
+++++[Health] boss (makes spawn larger with more health)
[Health] twins (makes 2 of the same spawn with 75% damage, and slight max speed increase)
[Health] masked (can only be hit from behind, this also gives it an ice like effect locking it's direction)
[Health] Reflective (causes the reflect modifier for ranged shots) (for use with bubble shield style summons, also a massive damper on ranged weapons)
[Health] Minion (half default health, but summons 3) (useful for Zerge rushes)
+++++[Health] Stout (size and damage decreases relative to health)
[Health] Dopple Heart (shares player health)
[Health] Timid (will turn to stone unmoveable or attackable when an enemy is close) {Anti melee}
??[Health] Spectral (ony takes damage from continuous, aoe, air strike, or any other devine style magic mod)
[Health] Reinforcements (When taking damage for the first time, spawn a bunch of coppies of the summon on the edges of the screen, 3*mod_count)





-----attack styles (default is walking into the player)
---new---
	Passive (This prevents the default collision damage, and applies damage to health, relative to mod count. For players this is [probably] a worthless mod)
	Neutural (This prevents the default enemy tracking, but if a player deals any damage to this entity it will permanately focus on the first player who dealt damage to it, then then next successive player in queue, this provieds a substantial damage increase for the entity, and the first damage is ignored, but it acts like it was damaged still giving it iframes)
	+++Charge (if enemy is with in the direction it is currently moveing dash in that direction untill you collide with something, this is grid based movement only? 1-2 second cool down for player possesion, longer to normal) [movement speeds: 1 chunk in 4 seconds, 2.666, 1.333, 1, 0.5]
	+++Kamikaze (it will explode when it is close to the player, when it dies, or when the possesion player uses ability 3)
	Trail of creep (leaves it behind their movement, not effected by player movement)
	Continum Charge (the entity dashes from it's current location off the screen, back on from the other side, and lands on it's same location-ish. this attack can only be used left and right, never any other direction) [modcount = number of selves which will dash the screen the second time, of mod count is only 1 then there is no second time]
	Minion Production (This allows them to spawn 3-7 extremely basic minions, trying to use this attack after they already have max minions only produces a projectile shot at the desired enemy, this projectile does make use of other ranged based mods) [boss mode makes each projectile into a volly of projectiles instead]
	Squirt [maybe better name] (shoots a random volly of 3-5 projectiles, the volly is with in a 90 degree area of desired location, every second when player controlled, longer for normal)
	Ranged (Shoots [modcount] projectiles, directly at the player)
	Burst Shot (Shoots [modcount]=[3,4,6,8,12] projectiles out in even directions from it's movement's closest cardinal direction so if moving movestly left it will start the first projectile aimed perfectly left) [the bursts are loaded when the cooldown passes, so when you already have 1 burst loaded, it doesnt have to be used, and the next 4 can still be loaded, 5 bursts can be loaded at one time, though if it's an enemy maybe add a delay for their desired attack time]
	knockback (this is a passive attack which knocks back all entities; modcount 1 = 5 second delay, with a 3 tile knockback; modcount 2 = 2 seconds, 4 tiles; modcount 3 = 1 second, 4 tiles; modcount 4 = 0 second, 4 tiles; modcount 5 = 0 second, 6 tiles;)
	Massive Jump (3 frame jump off the top of the screen, for 1 second this mod takes movement control and can move at double the max speed durring this time, It will be able to move over any non-wall obsticle and land onto the enemy, if enemy controlled will miss 2/3 of the times OR enemy AI can only dictate this movement for the first half second, if summoned will miss 1/4 of the time, cool down should be considered on timing when programmed)
	Cross beams (X shaped laser beams coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 3 seconds, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
	Plus beams (+ shaped laser beams coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 3 seconds, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
	Laser Eye (A directional laser beam coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 0 second for the player and 1 second for anything else, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
	Stomp (A small jump, then pound to the ground, it's just a weak AOE+knockback, modcount = AOE size)
	Meateor Swarm (modcount = meteors, spawn a bunch of meteors which falls from the sky, pre mark their landing possitions, and never spawn any ontop of the player, or in front of the player, summons will have a shorter delay on this attack and will have a random percent 20-100 of which meteors will be spawns on an enemy, player possesed will spawn 50% of meteors ontop of enemies every time, and only a 20% chance to spawn one on a enemy-PLAYER) [Isaac's crack the sky effect]
	Spin attack (basically just spin in circles, in a 1/2 chunk radius, if colliding with a wall, get some extreme knockback in the other direction, also throwing out projectiles 3 a second, inspired by TBoI's Greed mode boss)
	Bomber (throws timed bombs)
	

[Attack] Sef Destruct (explodes, dealing half it's remaining health with a max of ___) (if this modifier is mixed with timer, just make it explode at the end of the timer)
[Attack] ranged (will shoot projectiles)
[Attack] bumper (doesnt actually hurt the player but gives a high knockback)
+++++[Attack] Leaper (lunges twords the player)
[Attack] Kamikaze (similar to leaper, but will explode on collision)
[Attack] Passive (no attack, instead any damage multiplier is given to health)
[Attack] Childish (no attack, instead any damage multiplier is given to movement)
[Attack] Drain (constant AOE damage, very slow rate though) (halo 3's power drain equipment)
[Attack] Healing (constant AOE healing, very slow rate though) (halo 3's regen equipment)
[Attack] Pulling (constant AOE force pull)
[Attack] Psychic (shoots homing shots (better homing for modcount))
[Attack] Rotational (rotates and shoots at the player, if the summon is a minion/group they could rotate around each other)
[Attack] Dopple Strike (shares player attack system)
[Attack] Looting (less damage, but if it kills an AI enemy (non summon) then when it dies it will drop an item)
[attack] spitter (spits up a trail of creep, modcount = length of trail)
[propultion] shoots out a bunch of short ranged projectiles behind it, rocketing it around the room bouncing off walls dealing collision damage and projectile damage. (mod count = time propultion happens)
[attack] telekenisis (makes use of the gravity gun modifier)
[attack] mimic (prevent any other mod from activating untill an enemy player is with in striking range, if no enemies are nearby, then stick near your owner) 
[attack] Hidden (Will not be drawn untill an enemy player is with in striking range, if summoned when drawing the owners camera view, make the summon transparent)

-----movement (the default is directly walking at the nearest player)
---new---
	Grid based movement, (this is a faster movement style with the side effects that it can only move in the 4 directions)
	Flight, (This is free directional movement, which allows for moving over objects, although it will converge undesired inputs into the desired ones with a sine wave which rocks back and forth from top-left and bottom-right)
	Bouncy, (Moves around the room slowly, bouncing off the walls, if it's an enemy it will always start it's initial movement diagonally, if it's player spawned it will move in the direction it was summoned, if player controlled they can only slightly ajust it's speed and angle, but it will not diverge from it's initial path untill it collides with a wall.) [speed = modcount tiles per second]
	Burrow, (can only move while it's underdround, collision is turned off, and it must come back up once every 3 seconds, if it's current location is block either nudge it over 8 pixels, or deal some dagame to it and dont make it come back up then restart the timer, can not attack while under ground)
	Leaper, (it's actually a lot like airstrike in mechanics, dont move unles given an input, only move while leap is active, other movement mods can either take place before or after, or dynamically change the speed based on if it's in or out of a jump. this one will take some trouble shooting to see what works save it for later)
	Teleport, (This is less of a movement type and more of a movement ability, almost exactly the same as Massive Jump, although the entity goes invisible, and will do it's best to use this effect when a projectile is on a collision course for it, or if the player is out of reach)
	Inverse Movement, (Will always try to reach the closest possition oposite of the player, although this does give the summon infinate flight, if it is outside, simly try to stay on the edge of the player camera? idk If it is player possesed let it move freely, with the usual restrictions on flight)
	Skiddish (lunges away from a player who attacked with in range)
	
[Move] Bouncy (spawns in the direction the player was facing, will continue to move and bounce off walls untill dead)
[Move] Spastic (bee like movement, very random, much wow)
[Move] Jumpy (only moves in bursts, similar to terarria's slimes)
+++++[Move] Orbital (obits around the player, modcount = distance from player)
[Move] Chained (spawns in chained to a stake in the ground, after a while it can break free of the chain and moves much faster, modcount = extra damage, 3 or more makes it not able to leave the chain)
[Move] Momentum (moves quickly but has a hard time turning) (like a wheel or ball, similar to terarria's demon eyes)
[Move] Stationary (massive health increase, with no movement)
[Move] Hover (pit falls, and floor damage wont hurt)
[Move] Wall Hugger (follows the path of the nearest wall (clockwise), modcount = speed)
[Move] Burrow (allows the enemy to burrow underground, modcount = higher resurface distance (can not pop out ontop of a player, but can an other enemy))
[Move] Ghostly, (Has the ability to move through walls although it will be able to be hit through walls by melee weapons)
[Move] Aerial (similar to moms foot in binding of isaac,  a lot like burrow, or ghostly, but drops in from the sky)
??[Move] Remote controlled (player controls it, and the player can not move when doing so)
[Move] Dopple Legs (shares player movement)
[Move] Greedy (will steal things off the ground, slowing him down and increasing damage, although will prioritize stealing over attacking, drops the last three items it stole on death)
[Move] Spector (move through walls although can also be hit through walls, modcount = number of walls to move through)
[Move] Scaredy (will run away from players and enemies, movement greatly increases although its a shitty movement direction)
[Move] Stealthy?? (Turns to stone when the player is far enough away and an enemy projectile exists with in range) {Anti melee}
[Move] Swimming (This will always take last priority, but if the summon is not inside water it will flail around, although if it is, it gets double the movement speed. and a passive default movement mod)

--passive/toy summon mods (not really specific to any particular mod section, like the weapon's toy mods)
[Toy] Ridable (This allows for the NPC to be mounted, and controlled by the player mounting it. This is very similar to being possessed, although it's not timed, and the player is carried with the AI, The player is also perfectly invulnerable while mounting an AI)
[toy] blood shot (shoots out 6 or 8 projectiles apawn death)
[toy] blood trail (slightly less health, but leaves a trail of damaging floor tiles, or maybe smaller red shadowy versions of it's self.)
[passive] Spawner ( every 3.5-(0.5*modcount) seconds it spawns a minion version of it's self, with a max of 3)
[toy] Throwable (similar code as used in melee throwable although with out the 0.25 delay, but this allows for pokeballs to be a usable item)









Synergies

Guiding + Airstrike should make the weapon laser guided? same code as targeting?
