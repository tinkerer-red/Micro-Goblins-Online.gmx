---[WELCOME]---
Welcome Artists! We have a massive list of modifiers you should have along with this insperation file.
  Incase you haven't been informed the idea of the game revolves around taking the enchantment /augment
  systems from other games and making that the primary focus. Unfortunately this means we will need an
  absolute ton of images for each combination of 2. This file is a list of some of the insperations
  which helped me refine the modifier system down to a few key components. There have been a ton of which
  I had to cut out for the initial builds due to the sheer number sprites we already have to deal with.
  If there is anything you would like to make please feel free to. Most all of the work will be used
  regardless. The system will genorate the sprite depending on the modifiers when it spawns, for instance
  if a monster dropped the Num-Chucks (melee + doublestrike + swift) and the player added the "ranged"
  modifier, then the base image would still be the Num-Chucks. Adding a modifier will not change it's
  sprite or it's projectile sprite. This really shouldn't cause for any issues but this method will cut
  back on the number of sprites by about 130,000. Which should really make this system far more managable
  for a small team. Any art posted to the #Art channel in the discord will imediately be saved, so if any
  updates are needed to be made please make sure the file name is the same as when you uploaded it. Also
  make sure you've marked your work in the meta data for the file. If you dont know how to do this there
  are plenty of tutorials online, or simply ask Red. Once more thanks for being on the team. The following
  is just a mark up of the total rough estimated number of sprites for each catagory.
-------------

---[Stats]---
16 global mods and 16 specific 16 mods would be a base33 numeral system, since we will include the
  nill value (if a mod isnt equipped to that slot)

There for 550 sprites per catagory.

Melee = 550+17 mod combinations (the +16 is because once you have ranged that only opens up 1 slot
  for a ranged mod, and there is only 16 ranged mods planned for alpha, and the blank mod slot)
Ranged = 550 mod combinations
Projectiles = 550+16 (the ranged weapons, and the 16 melee weapons with the ranged mod)

Some simple math means a total of 1684 sprites doing 2 a day would take about 2.3 years, So feel
 free to rush through the ones you dont really wanna work on. If anything stands out we can clean it
 up in the future.

At the time of writing I'm having issues finding some unique and interesting Melee weapons from games,
 movies, and mytholigy. We only need 5 more modifiers for the beta list to be finished. And really the
 hardest part for the melee weapons will be designing the unique sprites for them so they actually feel
 different. Which is a monumental task, how would "repeater+swiftness" be much different from "repeater+tiny"?

===[Thanks]===
I really want to take a moment to thank you for joining the team. The sheer number of sprites is far
to much for one man to produce on his own with in a reasonable time. Having you on the team is a
privilage and is greatly appreciated.

Thank you;
Red
